My guilty pleasure is wasting time on Reddit. My actual pleasure is reading new books. I wanted a Chrome extension that would give me a gentle reminder of how to feel better about where I spent my time. I added the weather and location to let me know if I could sit outside and read under a tree instead of under a Reddit.

This extension querys four APIs for data:
* [The New York Times books API](http://developer.nytimes.com/books_api.json "NYT books API") - book data.
* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api "OpenWeatherMap API") - current weather based on location.
* [ip-api](http://ip-api.com/# "ip-api.com") - aproximate location based on public ip address.
* [ipify](https://www.ipify.org/ "ipify") - retrieve public facing ip address.
